Title: "Building Static Libraries in C"

**Task 0: Creating a Static Library**

In this task, you are required to create a static library named "libmy.a" that includes the functions listed below. If you haven't implemented all of these functions, please create empty ones with the correct function prototypes. Additionally, ensure that your "main.h" file contains prototypes for all the functions mentioned.

**Task 1: Script for Static Library Creation**

To simplify the process of creating a static library from multiple source files, you should develop a script named "create_static_lib.sh." This script will create a static library named "liball.a" by collecting all the ".c" files present in the current directory.

By completing these tasks, you will efficiently manage your library and simplify the creation of static libraries, laying the foundation for your programming projects.
